🚗 Rydora – Ride-Sharing App for Real-World Urban Mobility
Rydora is a real-world, production-oriented ride-sharing system designed with cost efficiency, scalability, and security in mind. Unlike typical monolithic ride-hailing apps, Rydora follows a decoupled architecture where mobile clients are lightweight and the core intelligence runs in a Python-based administrative matcher.

This repository contains the Passenger App, Rider (Driver) App, and the Python Admin Matcher that together form the complete Rydora ecosystem.

📌 Key Features
📍 High-precision routing & fare estimation (Passenger)
🗺️ Low-cost real-time navigation using OpenStreetMap (Rider)
🧠 Centralized Python-based matching engine (Admin)
🔥 Realtime synchronization via Firebase Firestore
🔐 Secure matching with OTP-based ride start
📊 Live analytics & admin controls via Jupyter Notebook

Rider App (Flutter + OpenStreetMap)
The mobile apps are stateless clients, while all critical logic (matching, validation, overrides) is executed in the Python Admin layer.

🧭 1. Mapping & Routing Strategy
👤 Passenger Side – GraphHopper API
Used for accurate distance calculation and fare estimation.

Flow:

Passenger selects pickup & destination

App sends a GET request to the GraphHopper Routing API

Response contains:

Route polyline
Total distance (meters)
Weight / duration
Usage:

Draw route on map
Calculate fare using a price_per_km constant
🚖 Rider Side – OpenStreetMap (OSM)
Optimized for cost-efficiency and continuous tracking.

Implementation:

flutter_map with OpenStreetMap tiles
No paid API required
Functionality:

Rider location sampled every 5–10 seconds
Location pushed to Firestore active_riders collection
Acts as a heartbeat for the matching engine
🧠 2. Python "Admin" Matcher (Jupyter Notebook)
The Jupyter Notebook acts as:

Matching engine
Admin dashboard
Analytics console
Emergency recovery tool
No separate admin app is required.

A. Ride Matching Loop
The matcher runs continuously using a while True loop or Firestore listener.

Steps:

Fetch Ride Requests

Query ride_requests where status == "pending"
Fetch Active Riders

Query active_riders where is_online == true
Distance Calculation (Haversine)

def calculate_distance(p1, p2):
    # Haversine formula
    return distance
Assignment Logic

Select nearest rider

Update Firestore:

rider_id
status = "matched"
B. Admin Operations via Python
All admin controls are implemented as dedicated notebook cells.

👥 User Management
Ban / unban users
Verify drivers
Inspect profiles
📊 Analytics
Ride density visualization
Peak-hour analysis
Historical demand patterns
Implemented using pandas and matplotlib

🔄 System Recovery
Reset stuck rides
Clear inactive drivers
Handle app crash scenarios
🔁 3. Data Flow Architecture
Component	Technology	Responsibility
Passenger App	Flutter + GraphHopper	Route preview, fare estimate, ride request
Rider App	Flutter + OSM	Live tracking, navigation
Database	Firebase Firestore	Real-time state sync
Logic Layer	Python (Jupyter)	Matching, lifecycle management, admin control
⚡ 4. Technical Advantages
🔐 Decoupled & Secure
Matching logic is not exposed in mobile apps
Users cannot manipulate rider selection
💰 Cost Optimized
OSM used for high-frequency driver tracking
Paid APIs used only where precision matters
🧪 Admin Flexibility
Live code execution
No redeployment needed for new reports or fixes
🔒 5. Security & Authentication
🔑 Firestore Security Rules
Passengers: can create ride requests

Python Admin (Service Account):

Only entity allowed to assign rider_id
🔢 OTP-Based Ride Start
Python Admin generates a 4-digit OTP on match
Driver must enter OTP to begin the trip
Prevents fake or accidental ride starts

🌍 Real‑World Problem Statement
Urban mobility today faces several critical challenges:

❌ Inefficient rider–passenger matching causing long wait times
❌ High dependency on expensive proprietary map APIs
❌ Centralized logic inside mobile apps, making systems vulnerable to manipulation
❌ Lack of flexibility for admins to monitor, intervene, or analyze ride data in real time
❌ Poor scalability for academic or early‑stage startup implementations
Rydora is designed to solve these exact real‑world issues using a clean, modular, and cost‑efficient architecture.

🚦 What Problem Does Rydora Solve?
Rydora addresses real urban ride‑sharing problems by separating responsibilities across three layers:

1️⃣ Fair & Transparent Ride Matching
Instead of embedding ride‑matching logic inside the mobile app (which users can reverse‑engineer or manipulate), Rydora:

Executes matching in a secure Python Admin engine
Uses geographical distance (Haversine) for fair driver assignment
Ensures passengers always get the nearest available rider
This mirrors how real ride‑hailing companies isolate core algorithms from clients.

2️⃣ Cost‑Effective Mapping Strategy
Commercial ride apps spend heavily on map APIs. Rydora minimizes cost by:

Using GraphHopper only for passengers, where accurate routing and pricing matter
Using OpenStreetMap (OSM) for riders, where frequent updates would otherwise be expensive
➡️ This hybrid strategy makes Rydora startup‑friendly and scalable.

3️⃣ Real‑Time Urban Mobility Tracking
Rydora continuously tracks:

Rider availability
Rider movement (heartbeat every 5–10 seconds)
Ride lifecycle stages
This enables:

Faster pickups
Better city‑level mobility insights
Real‑time decision making
🧠 Why the Python Admin Engine Matters (Real‑World Design)
Most student projects ignore admin control. Rydora treats it as a first‑class system component.

Admin Engine Capabilities:
🔄 Live ride matching without redeploying apps
👥 Driver verification & banning
📊 Demand & peak‑hour analytics
🛑 Emergency ride reset in crash scenarios
Using Jupyter Notebook allows admins to:

Write new logic instantly
Run diagnostics on live data
Perform safe system overrides
This closely resembles operations dashboards used by real ride‑sharing companies.

🔐 Security‑First Architecture
Rydora enforces strong backend control:

🔒 Firestore rules prevent riders or passengers from self‑assigning rides
🔑 Only the Admin service account can modify critical fields like rider_id
🔢 OTP‑based ride start ensures physical rider‑passenger verification
These measures reduce:

Fake ride starts
Data tampering
Unauthorized access
📊 Data‑Driven Urban Insights
Because all ride data flows through Firestore and Python:

Ride density maps can be generated
Peak demand hours can be analyzed
City‑wise expansion decisions can be simulated
This makes Rydora useful not only as an app, but also as a mobility analytics platform.

🧪 Academic & Industry Relevance

🎓 Final‑year / capstone projects
🚀 Startup MVPs
